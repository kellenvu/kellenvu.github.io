# **About Me**

Hi! I'm a recent graduate from Stanford, where I studied Human Biology and Computer Science.

My vision is to integrate health and technology to improve human lives. From 2017 to 2019, I was a research assistant at the Barrow Neurological Institute, investigating electrophysiological biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease. At Stanford, my research focused on the neuroplasticity of eye movement control, informing potential therapies for cerebellar disorders. Now, I'm leveraging my computational skills at Codex Health, a Silicon Valley startup whose mission is to enhance patient care through clinical intelligence solutions.
