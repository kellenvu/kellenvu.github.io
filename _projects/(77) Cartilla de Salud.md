# Cartilla de Salud

![Cartilla de Salud](/assets/projects/cartilla.jpg)

**Summary**: A bilingual resource to help patients track their health information

**When**: Spring 2023

**Where**: Pescadero, CA

**Collaborators**: [Katie Lu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/katie-lu-11059114a/), [Edward Tran](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edwardtran2/), [Puente](https://mypuente.org/)

## Problem

*In Pescadero, patients are in need of **more accessible health records**, due to **unreliable internet access**, **language barriers**, and **limited availability of medical care**.*

In 2019, a survey of 217 residents found that the top two requested human services were a **health care clinic** and **better high-speed internet**.

## Solution

We created a bilingual health pamphlet called the **Cartilla de Salud**, modeled after a government-issued document in Mexico called the **Cartilla Nacional de Salud**.
